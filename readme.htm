                Running these files will execute a simple batch validation of a selection of FpML
                examples. Some of the FpML examples published by ISDA contain mistakes and a few will output
                error messages.</li>

                Contains an XML catalog file (and its associated schema) used to resolve DTD system
                identifiers/schema namespace URIs to physical file locations and the business rule
                configuration file.<ul class="L2">

                        release and a set of additional definitions for currency and country codes. </li>

                        A copy of the FpML example file for each schema release. Some may contain mistakes

                        they are supposed to test.</li>

        <h2>
            Example Applications</h2>
        <p>
            The toolkit is provided with a simple test application (Validate.exe) that demonstrates
            its performance. Running the example batch file will process a small selection of
            FpML examples displaying the results to the screen.</p>
        <p>
            At the end of the run the program calculates the average processing &nbsp;time for
            each file and displays the number of rules tested against each file as shown below.</p>
        <pre>&gt;&gt; files/examples/fpml4-0/ird_ex26_fxnotional_swap_with_cfs.xml<br />&gt;&gt; files/examples/fpml4-0/ird_ex27_inverse_floater.xml<br />&gt;&gt; files/examples/fpml4-0/ird_ex28_bullet_payments.xml<br />&gt;&gt; files/examples/fpml4-0/msg_ex01_request_confirmation.xml<br />&gt;&gt; files/examples/fpml4-0/msg_ex02_trade_confirmed.xml<br />&gt;&gt; files/examples/fpml4-0/msg_ex03_portfolio.xml<br />&gt;&gt; files/examples/fpml4-0/td_ex01_simple_term_deposit.xml<br />&gt;&gt; files/examples/fpml4-0/td_ex02_term_deposit_w_settlement_etc.xml<br />== Processed 91 files in 1391 milliseconds<br />== 65.42056074766356 files/sec checking 219 rules</pre>
        <p>
            The application responds to a number of command line options and can be configured
            to test the FpML defined rules (e.g. excludes HandCoded rules including scheme value
            checking) or to use a more streamlined XML parsing technique that only supports
            schema based instances from FpML 4.0 or later. The default configuration is to process
            both DTD and schema based instances which is less efficient.</p>
        <p>
            Futures releases will add further demonstration applications</p>
