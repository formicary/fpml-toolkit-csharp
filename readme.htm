            will output error messages.</li>
        <li>Classify*.bat<br />
            <br />
            Running these files will execute a simple program that uses the classification tools
            within the toolkit to identifty the financial product within the example files.

        <li>files
            <br />
            <br />
            Contains an XML catalog file (and its associated schema) used to resolve DTD system

            configuration file.<ul class="L2">

                    <br />
                    A set of XML data files containing the scheme code values defined by FpML for each
                    release and a set of additional definitions for currency and country codes. </li>

                    <br />
                    A copy of the FpML example file for each schema release. Some may contain mistakes
                    as many have not been properly validated. </li>

                    <br />
                    A copy of the FpML validation test files for both valid and invalid case. It is
                    important to note some valid test cases still generate errors, just not the one
                    they are supposed to test.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        Example Applications</h2>
    <p>
        The toolkit is accompanied by some simple test scripts that demonstrates its functionality
        and performance.</p>
    <h3>
        Validation</h3>
    <p>
        The validation scripts (e.g. Validate1-0.bat, etc.) use a simple application (implemented
        as the class demo.com.handcoded.fpml.Validate) to process one or more XML files.
        Running one of the example batch files will process a small selection of FpML examples
        displaying the results to the screen.</p>
    <p>
        At the end of the run the program calculates the average processing &nbsp;time for
        each file and displays the number of rules tested against each file as shown below.</p>
    <pre>&gt;&gt; files/examples/fpml4-0/ird_ex26_fxnotional_swap_with_cfs.xml
&gt;&gt; files/examples/fpml4-0/ird_ex27_inverse_floater.xml
&gt;&gt; files/examples/fpml4-0/ird_ex28_bullet_payments.xml
&gt;&gt; files/examples/fpml4-0/msg_ex01_request_confirmation.xml
&gt;&gt; files/examples/fpml4-0/msg_ex02_trade_confirmed.xml
&gt;&gt; files/examples/fpml4-0/msg_ex03_portfolio.xml
&gt;&gt; files/examples/fpml4-0/td_ex01_simple_term_deposit.xml
&gt;&gt; files/examples/fpml4-0/td_ex02_term_deposit_w_settlement_etc.xml
== Processed 91 files in 1391 milliseconds
== 65.42056074766356 files/sec checking 219 rules</pre>
    <p>
        The application responds to a number of command line options and can be configured
        to test the FpML defined rules (e.g. excludes HandCoded rules including scheme value
        checking) or to use a more streamlined XML parsing technique that only supports
        schema based instances from FpML 4.0 or later. The default configuration is to process
        both DTD and schema based instances which is less efficient.</p>
    <h3>
        Classification</h3>
    <p>
        The classification scripts (e.g. Classify1-0.bat, etc.) execute a simple application
        that uses the toolkit to determine the type of financial product used within a trade
        or contract.</p>
    <pre>&gt;&gt; files\examples\fpml1-0\FRAExample8.xml:
= FpML 1-0
: Trade(FORWARD RATE AGREEMENT)
&gt;&gt; files\examples\fpml1-0\IRSExample1.xml:

    <p>
        Futures releases will add further demonstration applications.</p>
